#Modular CSS

##Learning Objectives

* Abstract your styles with classes
* Design modular CSS classes
* Organize your CSS into reusable components

###Steps

Refer to the `index.html`. 

##Exercises

###SHOUT IT OUT!

Create a class `.uppercase` that uppercases the text of "Modular CSS". 

###Align right

Create a class `.align-right` that will move "Modular CSS" to the right of the page.

###Shadow

Create a class called `.shadow` that creates a drop shadow for the "Modular CSS" text.


###Coloring

Create three separate classes:

* `.white-text` that makes "Modular CSS" white
* `.red-background` that makes the `header` element's background red
* `.blue-background` that makes the `main` element's background blue
* `.yellow-background` that we will use later

###Sizing

You may have noticed that the three boxes have changed colors. That's because the class names we just defined had already been applied to them earlier. Now let's mess with changing their size.

Create two separate classes:

* `.wide` that makes the width of an element `4em`
* `.narrow` that makes the width of an element `2em`

###Operators

Create a class `.operators` that make the the operators `+` & `=`  have a font-size of `2em` and centers them vertically with the shapes (HARD).

###~~Strike out~~

Create a class `.strike` that will strike out any text in the element it is applied to.

<!--Create a line across the screen. Use classes to cut it in half and center it-->

###Cut it / in half

Create a class `.half` that will cut an element's size by 50%.

<!--Invert the photo-->

###Invert

Create a class `.invert	` that flips the photo of the old woman upside down.

<!--todo-->

###Circle

Create a class called `.circle` and add it to the three boxes to make them circles.

###Technically Speaking

Create a class `.technical` that will add a yellow background to any element. Like `this`.

###Bonus

* Box model
